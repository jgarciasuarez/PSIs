# Phase-Space Iterative Solvers (PSIs)

This repository contains materials to reproduce results presented in the preprint "Phase-space iterative solvers" (arXiv:2309.14031).

## Contents

- `Plate_w_hole_PSI_2025_influence_method.pdf`: Detailed document on the phase-space iterative solver applied to a plate with a hole. For access to the Mathematica file, feel free to contact me, I'll be happy to share it.

## Additional Resources

The Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts used for the truss example and neural network training associated with it can be retrieved from the [NN_iterative_solver repository](https://gitlab.epfl.ch/gcortes/nn_iterative_solver).
